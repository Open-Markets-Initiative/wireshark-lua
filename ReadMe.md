# Omi Lua Wireshark Dissectors

[![Wireshark](https://github.com/Open-Markets-Initiative/Directory/blob/main/About/Images/Wireshark.png)](https://www.wireshark.org)

Omi Lua Wireshark dissectors provide easily customized, cross platform viewing of common binary exchange protocols.

## Usage

To dissect packets, place lua script(s) in the wireshark plugins directory.

The standard user path on a windows install (please create the plugins directory):

```
%APPDATA%\Wireshark\plugins\
```
On a linux install use:

```
//usr/share/wireshark/plugins
```
For configuration information: [Wireshark Plugin Configuration](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/ChPluginFolders.html "Wireshark Configuration Documentation")

Note: Some packets contain enough information to programmatically determine the correct protocol specification and/or version at runtime.  *Many do not.*  If you add multiple dissectors to your plugins folder, wireshark will dissect each "conversation" based on the first matching protocol.  In these cases, please manually select protocol dissector using Analyze | Decode As….

For decoding information: [Wireshark Protocol Decoding](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/ChCustProtocolDissectionSection.html "Wireshark Protocol Selection Documentation")
## Development

Updates are greatly appreciated; however, this entire repository is source generated...including the words you are reading right now. If you wish to suggest script updates, the recommended process is to create an issue with changes and explanation.  Time permitting, we will update the models and regenerate.

| Protocol Count | Generated Lines |
| --- | --- |
| 340 | 3,415,907 |

Note: Our dissector model is still under rapid development.

## Testing

[![Test](https://github.com/Open-Markets-Initiative/wireshark-lua/actions/workflows/github-action-lua.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Open-Markets-Initiative/wireshark-lua/actions//workflows/github-action-lua.yml)

Please report any dissection errors as an [issue](https://github.com/Open-Markets-Initiative/wireshark-lua/issues "Omi Lua Wireshark Issues").  Include a small note on the protocol and version, and a minimal capture demonstrating the problem. Also consider including a link or pdf specification documenting the correct behavior.

Production packet captures are required for protocol verification.  If your organization has the rights to packet captures, and you wish to make the world a better place, please post captures to this project.
